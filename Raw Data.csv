With BVNK, businesses can send and receive stablecoin payments, convert between currencies, and add stablecoin payments to their checkout. Using our flexible platform and robust global licensing and compliance expertise, innovators can launch new payment products quickly and compliantly.

We are a diverse team spread across EMEA, North America, and APAC, with a shared belief that all payment flows will interact with crypto in the coming decade, and BVNK will be at the forefront of this transformation of the financial system.

We recently secured a strategic investment from Visa through their Visa Ventures arm. This follows our $50 million Series B in December, led by Haun Ventures with participation from Coinbase Ventures, Scribble Ventures, DRW Venture Capital, Avenir, and Tiger Global.

Description
Are you passionate about challenges? Izertis is the company for you.

We're looking for someone with experience in Python, Node, and DevOps to work 100% remotely on the development of blockchain-based digital products for the Izertis innovation team.

What do we do?

In the Izertis innovation team, we develop high-quality, innovative digital products with a strong innovation component in a changing environment. We are a team of self-organized individuals who work remotely and are constantly learning.

We're working on Decentralized Digital Identity (Self-Sovereign Identity), tokenization (NFTs and similar black magic), and shared trusted data for value ecosystems in healthcare, industry, education, social care, banking, and insurance.

And we're also involved in highly innovative projects in generative artificial intelligence.

Ultimately, our goal is to provide our customers with solutions based on innovative, useful, secure, and usable technologies.

What do we offer?

An environment where all opinions are welcome to improve our processes day by day.
Services that help maintain and improve the work environment, such as 1-on-1 meetings, anonymous satisfaction surveys, and simplifying vacation planning and scheduling.
Work from wherever you want. We were already doing this before the lockdown, and we've fine-tuned our processes.
Internal training sessions.
What will you do?

Develop, test, document, and deploy applications and microservices.
Supervise and guide other team members.
Participate in agile ceremonies and meetings.
Research and improve the company's technology stack and knowledge bases.
Who are we looking for?

Manager of one, someone who can create their own goals and execute them without much direction.
Proactivity and good communication help us work better every time.
Love for creating clean, testable code every day.
Ability to work collaboratively in a multidisciplinary team (Design+UI/UX+Backend+Blockchain…).
Hands-on experience with Python/Django and NodeJS (if you haven't, you'll need to) and Gitflow over the past 3-5 years.
Knowledge of Docker and Lambdas (or similar), CI/CD configuration, as well as deployment and infrastructure techniques.
Critical thinking and problem-solving orientation.
Good level of English (spoken and written).
Minimum requirements
How do we work?

We have a process for detecting and validating features using User Story Mapping.
We do dailies (short daily meetings where we say what we did yesterday and what we are going to do today).
We do sprints weekly.
We do CI/CD (Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment) on all our projects, so it's important that everything is well tested, both frontend and backend, and we monitor the test coverage each project has.
We do code reviews: before we push new code into production, someone on the team must review it and approve it (your first accepted pull request will have lots of GIFs, I promise!).
We work with Python and NodeJS in the backend mainly, but we also touch on any other technology or language that we see necessary (Typescript, Next.js and React/Redux in the frontend, Go... ).
What will the process be like?

The selection process will not last more than three weeks.
We'll have three interviews: an initial one to get to know each other, a second one with the team you'll be working with, and a final technical one.
Who are we?

With over 28 years of experience, Izertis, listed on the BME Continuous Market and among the 1,000 fastest-growing companies in Europe, offers you the opportunity to develop your professional career alongside over 2,300 employees through its offices across Europe, the Americas, and Africa.

Core Infrastructure: Build and scale backend systems that process transactions, ensure correctness, and provide strong guarantees around scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance.
Transaction Reliability: Optimize transaction throughput, gas efficiency, and system resilience across chains and distributed services
Collaboration: Work closely with product, compliance, and business teams to deliver end-to-end solutions
Ownership: Participate in technical roadmap planning and carry projects from design through production
User Focus: Engage with customers to understand their needs and translate them into effective solutions


Basic Qualifications

Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Math, or related STEM field, or equivalent practical experience
2+ years of professional software development experience
Proficiency in one or more programming languages (JavaScript/TypeScript with Node.js, Go, Python, etc.)
Experience working with RESTful APIs
Familiarity with blockchain concepts (EOA vs. SCA, blockchain consensus, signature, EIP protocol, replay attack, transactions, events, etc.)
Experience with PostgreSQL or other relational databases

Strong communication and collaboration skills with both technical and non-technical teams


Preferred Skills & Experience

Interested candidates who meet the basic qualifications should consider applying. The following preferred skills and experience are helpful for this role, but candidates with only some of them are able to be successful on our team. Learning on the job is critical success and part of the excitement of working at HIFI.


Hands-on experience building or integrating with smart contracts (Solidity, Rust, Move, or similar)
Strong understanding of blockchain architecture, consensus mechanisms, and applied cryptography fundamentals
Experience working with Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains (Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Avalanche, etc.) as well as Solana; familiarity with additional ecosystems such as Sui, Tron, or Canton is a plus

Want to work closely with a highly collaborative, low-ego team who commits for the mission. 
At least 4 years industry experience

Benefits:

Competitive salary, performance-based incentives, and token allocation grant
Opportunity to work with a Top 5 Ethereum protocol, by TVL
